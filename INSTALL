I have cross-compiled this project on an Ubuntu desktop machine using
Go version go1.0.2 with the commmand:
GOARCH=arm GOOS=linux CGO_ENABLED=0 go build panpigo.go

After building panpigo, copy the panpigo exectuable to your pi. Also
copy panpigo.html, the js directory, and the pianobar directory.

Follow the pianobar instructions for compiling on the Pi.  Please let
me know if you find a way to cross-compile pianobar.  The pianobar in
this github repository is a fork because I couldn't figure out a way
to get the information needed using the FIFO.
